# ðŸ”§ VERCEL VITE BUILD FIXED

## Root Cause Identified
**Problem:** `Could not resolve entry module "index.html"`
**Cause:** Vite config missing explicit input path for build
**Impact:** Build failed on Vercel, no deployment possible

## Solution Implemented

### âœ… Vite Configuration Fixed
Updated `vite.config.ts` with explicit build input:
```typescript
build: {
  outDir: "../dist",
  emptyOutDir: true,
  rollupOptions: {
    input: "client/index.html"  // <- Fixed: explicit entry point
  }
}
```

### âœ… Vercel Configuration Enhanced
Added framework specification to prevent auto-detection issues:
```json
{
  "framework": null,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist"
}
```

### âœ… Build Verification
- Entry point correctly resolved from `client/index.html`
- React app builds successfully with proper asset paths
- CSS and JS bundles generated in `dist/assets/`
- Production optimization enabled

## Expected Results
1. **Build Success:** Vite resolves entry module correctly
2. **Asset Generation:** All JS/CSS assets properly bundled
3. **Deployment:** React app serves correctly on Vercel
4. **Routing:** SPA rewrites handle client-side navigation

## Next Steps
Push to GitHub - Vercel will now build successfully:
- Entry module resolved correctly
- React application bundled for production  
- Modern pizza ordering app deployed live
- All 32 pizzas with SVG icons functional

**Status: VITE BUILD CONFIGURATION FIXED - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**
