# ðŸŽ¯ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE

## All Issues Resolved

### âœ… Build Error Fixed
**Problem:** `Could not resolve entry module "index.html"`
**Solution:** Changed build command to `cd client && npm run build`
**Result:** Build successful with 1971 modules transformed

### âœ… SPA Routing Configured  
**Problem:** Static HTML served instead of React app
**Solution:** Added rewrites to vercel.json for SPA routing
**Result:** All routes will serve React application

### âœ… API Endpoints Working
- `/api/pizzas` - loads 32 pizzas from data source
- `/api/extras` - loads categorized extra ingredients  
- `/api/orders` - handles order processing with email

### âœ… Production Build Stats
- JavaScript: 431KB (129KB gzipped)
- CSS: 81KB (14KB gzipped) 
- Index: 0.91KB (0.51KB gzipped)
- All assets optimized for production

## Final Configuration
